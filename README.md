# QuoteStack

QuoteStack is a procurement intelligence platform that helps teams collect, normalize, and compare supplier quotes per deal so decisions are made faster, with fewer errors, and less manual work.

Most teams still manage supplier pricing through spreadsheets, emails, and PDFs. QuoteStack replaces that fragmented process with a structured system that turns quotes into clear decisions.

## The Problem

Supplier sourcing is messy and inefficient. Teams typically:

- Collect quotes over email or chat
- Manually normalize currencies, MOQs, and lead times
- Compare options in spreadsheets
- Lose historical pricing context between deals

This leads to slower decisions, pricing mistakes, and poor supplier selection.

---

## The Solution

QuoteStack centralizes supplier quotes at the deal level and applies structured comparison logic so teams can quickly identify the best option based on price, constraints, and timing.

Instead of manually evaluating quotes, users see:

- Which supplier is best
- Why they are best
- How alternatives compare

Over time, QuoteStack builds pricing memory and supplier performance insights that compound in value.
